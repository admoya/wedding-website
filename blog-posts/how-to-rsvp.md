Invitations have been sent out! You should be getting yours soon. When you do, you will find a QR code on the back of the RSVP card. You can scan that code to go straight to your personal RSVP page!

If you haven't gotten your invitation yet or you don't want to use the QR code, you can go to the [rsvp](/rsvp) page and search for your name.
