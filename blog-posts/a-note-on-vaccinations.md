We have been waiting for this event for about two years now, and we've had to delay it multiple times because of COVID-19. Thankfully, we are confident that we will be able to proceed with our desired date of November 13th, 2021.

However, this is going to be a relatively large gathering in an enclosed space, and the reality is the pandemic is not over. We only feel comfortable going forward because we know that the vast majority of our friends and family have been vaccinated.

We believe strongly in the safety and efficacy of the FDA-approved vaccines, and we want to do everything possible to ensure that this event is safe for all guests. Therefore we are asking that all adult guests who plan to attend be vaccinated against COVID-19. This is not a policy that will be enforced through checking of vaccine cards, but rather a sincere request that we hope you will respect.

If you cannot or will not get vaccinated, then we ask that you please get COVID tested 48 hours before the event so that we can have a safe and stress-free celebration.
