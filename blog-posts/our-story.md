All the way back in 2012, a young girl from Lourdes met a charming young man from Belen, and they started dating a few weeks later. That girl was Jenny Hernandez, and that boy was Gabriel Mesa. It was not long before they broke up, at which point Adrian saw an opportunity to swoop in.

 Sparks flew, and later that year Adrian and Jenny attended the Belen Senior Prom together. That night, Adrian asked Jenny to be his girlfriend. She said no. When she saw how sad he got, she changed her mind. The rest is history.

In all seriousness, our story has been filled with so much love and so many memories. We’re still in shock that we are lucky enough to marry our high school sweethearts. Since we've been together, we’ve graduated high school, college, and graduate school, adopted two precious mutts, and bought a house together.

It wasn't always easy! We spent 5 years in a long-distance relationship, where we learned to appreciate every moment together.

November 13, 2021 will be a culmination of the story we’ve been drafting for nine years. It’s the beginning of a new journey for us both. We can’t wait to celebrate together with all of you who have played a role in our story. See you soon!
