Family and friends,

We are so excited to celebrate our love with those we hold dear. As you all know, we have been waiting to get married for over two years (and that doesn't count the 7 years of dating before that!), and we've had to delay our celebration multiple times because of COVID-19. Thankfully, we are confident and thrilled to be able to get married on November 13th, 2021.

We cannot ignore the impact the Coronavirus has had on our lives. It's clich√©, but we really have been through "unprecendented" times and have experienced loss in so many forms, including time with those we love and cherish most.

The pandemic is not over. We want to do everything in our power to ensure that this event is safe and that we can all celebrate without worrying about sickness. Our wedding is going to be a relatively large gathering in an enclosed space. We only feel comfortable going forward because we know that the vast majority of our friends and family have been vaccinated.

We strongly believe in the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, and we want to do everything possible to protect the health of our guests. Therefore, we are asking that all adults who plan to attend be vaccinated against COVID-19. This is not a policy that will be enforced through checking of vaccine cards, but rather a sincere request that we hope you will respect and consider.

We are also requiring that all guests (vaccinated or not) take a COVID-19 test at most 72 hours before the wedding and send a negative test result to Migdy Moya. More details will follow.

We thank you all for respecting our wishes.

Love,

Adrian and Jenny
